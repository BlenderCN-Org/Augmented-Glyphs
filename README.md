# Augmented-Glyphs
We use glyph pattern recognition to identify a glyph and then according to the glyph augment a 3D model. In this project, we have used 2 glyph patterns. We use OpenCV to identify the particular glut file. Once the glut file is identified, we use OpenGL to project a 3D model onto the particular glut.

## Execution
To execute the program, you need to install OpenCV, pygame, OpenGL, Pillow, numpy for python. Installation settings for all the functions can be found online.
To run the program just type in the following command in the terminal.
```bash
python main.py
```
